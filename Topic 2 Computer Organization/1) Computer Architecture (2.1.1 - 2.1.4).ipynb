    "## Outline the architecture of a central processing unit (CPU) \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how the CPU basically works is an essential part of being able to imagine what happens when code is executed. The code below gives a rough approximation of how the CPU works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU includes the Control Unit (CU), the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and registers. The CPU is the sort of \"box\" that houses those things. The CU is the manager which does a \"fetch\" on instruction set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that we write in a high-level, human-readable, language eventually gets converted into a machine code, which is just binary. This is represented in the `INSTRUCTIONS` variable. The raw instructions are sent to the ALU which performs operations as directed by the given instruction. The result of those operations are then stored in the register, represented by the `REGISTERS` variable."
