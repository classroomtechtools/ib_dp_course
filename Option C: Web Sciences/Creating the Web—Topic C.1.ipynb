The internet is the global network of computers that are connected through networking connections. These connections are hosted on a collection of cables and radios. Both sides of the connections have to talk to each other in a standard way, a kind of \"language\" some of which are very simple or very complex.\n",

    "Let's first look at one of the simplest examples of a protocol being used across the internet, and that is `ping` command. It uses the ICMP/IP protocol, which we usually just call the \"IP\" and all it does is receive a \"ping\" and echoes a response. This is a tool commonly used to check if internet servers are available or not.\n",
